JALDS (Java ALgorthms and Data Structures) pronounced JAL-DOES is an open source project that contains a variety of algorithms and 
data structures that you can use in your own code.
<p>
<em>Motivation : </em>
Have you ever wondered, <em>"What is the best sorting algorithm I should use ?" </em>, 
Well the only person who can answer that question is .... YOU. You know your data better than 
anyone else! And this project can help you experiment and choose the best one.
<p> 
Should you use a Binary Tree for sorting ever thing ?
not necessarily a regular binary tree will be fast only if you insert elements in a random order, 
can you guarantee that you will be inserting elements in random order ? Your other option is to use a RedBlack tree, 
that will guarantee that the tree is balanced but you pay an overhead for that.
<p>
Bubble Sort is the worst sort but easiest to implement, 
did you know there is a Comb Sort that is a very slight variation of Bubble Sort (hence easy to implement) 
but rivals complex sorts such as Quick Sort and Merge Sort in speed ?  Some of these Sorting algorithms are Stable 
(keeps the original order of keys, if two key have the same value), online 
(all keys need not be provided at the beginning) and off-line.
<p>
What if you wanted to compare a variety of algorithms and pick the best one, (and not just rely on the stuff that comes in the JDK).
then this project is for you.  
<em> Having many options is a good thing. </em>
<p>
This project aims to put all of these algorithms and its implementations in one easy spot for everyone 
to access, read and re-use.
