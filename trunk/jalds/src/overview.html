JALDS pronounced JAL-DOES is an open source project that contains a variety of algorithms and 
data structures that you can use in your own code.
<p>
<em>Motivation</em>
Have you ever wondered, <em>"What is the best sorting algorithm I should use ?" </em>, 
Well the only person who can answer that question is .... YOU. You know your data better than 
anyone else! And this project can help you experiment and choose the best one.
<p> 
Should you use a Binary Tree for sorting ever thing (HashTable is based on RedBlack trees) 
not necessarily what about AVL trees ? Bubble Sort is the worst sort but easiest to implement, 
did you know there is a Comb Sort that is a very slight variation of Bubble Sort (so easy to implement) 
but rivals complex sorts such as Quick Sort and Merge Sort in speed ?  Some of these Sorting algorithms are Stable 
(keeps the original order of keys, if the key values are the same), online 
(all keys need not be provided at the beginning) and off-line.
<p>
This project aims to put all of these algorithms, and its implementations in one easy spot for everyone 
to access, read and re-use.
<p>
Well now you have the freedom to experiment and pick and choose the very best data structure and 
algorithm for you project and of course you can get the source extend it to your heart's content.
