/**
 * (From Mastering Algorithms with C) Heaps : Trees organized so that we can
 * determine the node with the largest value quickly. The cost to preserve this
 * property is less than that of keeping the data sorted. We can also organize a
 * heap so that we can determine the smallest value just as easily.
 * 
 * There are two kinds of heaps min and max heap, in a max heap for every node
 * the parent is greater than equal to the child node.
 * 
 * Heaps are stored in arrays, the left and right child of any node i is 2(i)+1
 * and 2i+2 and parent of any node at position i in an array is (i-1)/2
