/**
 * Finds the strongly connected components in a given directed graph
 * 
 * A strongly connected component of a directed graph G=(V,E) is a max set of
 * vertices C such that for every pair of vertices u and v in C u is reachable
 * from v and v is reachable from u.
 * 
 * To find the strongly connected component in given graph G, we transpose G,
 * both G and G(t) will have the same strongly connected component
